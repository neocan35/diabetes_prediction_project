# Diabetes Prediction Using KNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict diabetes diagnosis. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the aim is to accurately determine whether individuals are at risk based on their health data. By utilizing this model, I try to demonstrate how machine learning can assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `diabetes.csv`, which includes the following:  
- **Predictor Variables**:  
  - Number of pregnancies (`Pregnancies`)  
  - Glucose level (`Glucose`)  
  - Blood pressure (`BloodPressure`)  
  - Skin thickness (`SkinThickness`)  
  - Insulin level (`Insulin`)  
  - BMI (`BMI`)  
  - Diabetes pedigree function (`DiabetesPedigreeFunction`)  
  - Age (`Age`)  
- **Target Variable**:  
  - `Outcome`: (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## Objective
The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis based on the medical metrics provided in the dataset.

## Technologies that will be Used
The following tools and libraries will be used in the project:
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

## Steps that will be Followed in the Project
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values (if any).  
   - Standardize/normalize features for better model performance.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize distributions of medical features.  
   - Check correlations between features and the target variable.  

3. **Model Development**:  
   - Implement the KNN algorithm using Scikit-learn.  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., the number of neighbors `k`).  

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Create confusion matrix visualizations.

## Results
The model results will be showed here.
